/**
 * @brief The main function. The entry point and currently where the simulation configuration is done.
 *
 * The main method is the basic configuration point in the project.
 * In order to define a system one has to include the desired headers
 * contained in the ../include/quantumsystems folder. This will provide the
 * desired potential function objects as well as some Eigenfunctions if the
 * system has a analytical solution. The next dependency is the choice of the
 * solver-rountine. This depends in the spatial dimensionality of the system.
 * Currently the project only provides the split-operator method in order to
 * solve a system to up to three dimensions. The general unit system the code
 * currently uses is the atomic unit system. If you aren't familiar with this
 * particular unit system, please read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_units.
 *
 * The argc argument specifies in the current implementation the number of OpenMP
 * threads the code uses. So for instane the call
 * ./ahti 4
 * will start a simulation with 4 OpenMP threads.
 *
 * In order to configure a simulation the user has to specify a grid of the
 * corresponding dimensionality. The headers are located in the ../include/grid
 * folder. In order to create a grid-spec object please refer to the documentation
 * of the corresponding headers.
 *
 * So in a nutshell:
 * 1. Include all the desired headers
 * 2. Instantiate the function objects of the test-wave-function and the potential
 * 3. Specify the grid parameters by instantiating a grid object
 * 4. Call the solver function
 *
 * @return: int code which indicates if the program ran succsessfull
